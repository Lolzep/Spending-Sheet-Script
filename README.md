# **Spending Sheet Script**

This is a script used for keeping a budget and tracking my revenues/expenses while I work gig economy work (DoorDash, GrubHub, etc.). Given two Google Sheets, it is able to:

* Take user-inputted revenues, expenses, miles, hours worked, and trips done and calculate a variety of different functions useful for understanding trends in your money and append them as rows on a separate sheet sorted by day.
* TODO: Create new weeks on the same sheet that write over the previous cells when a new week starts.

Just currently thinking of new things to add and updating as I go. Posting this on GitHub just in case it useful to someone!

To install:
* Go into the Google Sheet you wish to use this on
* Click on Extensions -> Apps Script
* Copy-paste the code into the newly created "macros.gs" file
* Edit the sheets in lines 6 and 7 to match the sheets you wish to use
* Enjoy!
